I use valgrind to check for memory leaks under Linux.  The gtk and related
libraries throw tons of errors because of the optimization techniques they
use.  We can suppress those errors by running valgrind as follows.  This
assumes you are in the build-linux directory:

make -j12 && valgrind --leak-check=full --suppressions=../valgrind/gtk.suppression --tool=memcheck ./tline > ~/log.mem 2>&1

This is not perfect - I still see gtk errors in the log, but at least it
cuts them down to a manageable level.
