This program uses wxFormBuilder to generate its user interface, so if you want
to make any UI changes, install wxFormBuilder and open tline.fbp.  Typing F8
in wxFormBuilder will regenerate the tlineUI.h and tlineUI.cpp files.

Compilation can be done by the following steps:

1) mkdir build
2) cd build
3) cmake ..
4) make

If you have a multi-core CPU, you can speed up the compilation by replacing
step 4 above with "make -jN" where N is number of CPU cores available.

If you need to see the full text of the commands being executed by "make", add
VERBOSE=1 to the command.  For example, to produce a verbose build, with 12
CPU cores available, step 4 would be:

make -j12 VERBOSE=1

This will result in the tline binary being created as "build/tline".  You
will need to have a development version of wxWidgets installed.  On Fedora
Linux this is provided by the wxGTK3-devel package.

tline is reasonably self-contained, but it does use gnuplot for graphing,
so you will need gnuplot installed somewhere accessible by your shell.

Fedora users can use the spec/tline.spec file to generate an RPM:

First, create a source archive.  Note that the version 0.0 must be changed
to match the version in the spec file.

git archive --format=tar.gz --prefix=tline-0.0/ -o ~/tline-0.0.tar.gz HEAD

Next, prepare a working directory:

mkdir -p ~/rpmbuild/{SPECS,SOURCES}
cp spec/tline.spec ~/rpmbuild/SPECS
mv ~/tline-0.0.tar.gz ~/rpmbuild/SOURCES
cd ~/rpmbuild

Now, run the build:

rpmbuild -ba SPECS/tline.spec

If you are set up for it, you could instead use mock, again adjusting the
version string and target Fedora version as necessary:

git archive --format=tar.gz --prefix=tline-0.0/ -o ~/tline-0.0.tar.gz HEAD
mkdir -p ~/rpmbuild/{SPECS,SOURCES}
cp spec/tline.spec ~/rpmbuild/SPECS
mv ~/tline-0.0.tar.gz ~/rpmbuild/SOURCES
cd ~/rpmbuild
rpmbuild -bs SPECS/tline.spec
mock -r fedora-30-x86_64 --rebuild ~/rpmbuild/SRPMS/tline-0.0-1.fc30.src.rpm
