0) General Information:
=======================

This program uses wxFormBuilder to generate its user interface, so if you
want to make any UI changes, install wxFormBuilder and open tline.fbp.
After making your changes, type F8 in wxFormBuilder to regenerate the
tlineUI.h and tlineUI.cpp files.

Development of Tline is done under Fedora Linux.  I also use Fedora Linux
to cross-compile packages for Windows and Ubuntu.

tline is reasonably self-contained, but it does use gnuplot (and xterm on
Linux) for graphing.  The Tline windows installer includes the needed
graphing components, and will install them on request.

1) Regarding destinations:
==========================

The default destination is /usr/local.  You can override it:

If you specify -DDEFAULT_PREFIX_PATH=/usr, then everything lands in
/usr.  There is nothing special about /usr; you could set the
DEFAULT_PREFIX_PATH to your home directory if you wanted everything
installed there.

2) Regarding debugging:
=======================

There is a flag, TLINE_DEBUG, which defaults to OFF.  If it is OFF,
a -O2 flag is added to the CFLAGS.  If it is ON, a -g flag is added to
the CFLAGS.

To turn the flag on, the syntax is cmake -DTLINE_DEBUG=ON

To turn the flag off, the syntax is cmake -DTLINE_DEBUG=OFF

3) Regarding stripping:
=======================

There is a flag, TLINE_STRIP, which defaults to ON.  If it is ON,
a -s flag is added to the CFLAGS.  If it is OFF, no flag will be added
to the CFLAGS.

To turn the flag off, the syntax is cmake -DTLINE_STRIP=OFF

To turn the flag on, the syntax is cmake -DTLINE_STRIP=ON

4) Summary:
===========

If you don't specify anything extra to cmake, files will land in
/usr/local/bin and /usr/local/share, and the executable will be stripped
and built with -O2.

Note that setting -DTLINE_DEBUG=ON will override -DTLINE_STRIP=ON, because
it makes no sense to use CFLAGS with both -g and -s.

5) BUILDING FOR FEDORA LINUX
============================

5a) Manual Builds
=================

The following packages are required in order to build and run tline manually
on a Fedora system:

For building, you will need:

  cmake
  gcc-c++
  wxGTK-devel
  vim-common
  ImageMagick
  desktop-file-utils
  libappstream-glib

For running, you will need:

  gnuplot-wx
  xterm

All of the above packages can be installed via:

dnf install cmake gcc-c++ wxGTK-devel vim-common ImageMagick \
  desktop-file-utils libappstream-glib gnuplot-wx xterm

Once the above requirements are installed, compilation for Fedora
can then be done by the following steps:

mkdir build-fedora
cd build-fedora
cmake ..
make

If you have a multi-core CPU, you can speed up the compilation by replacing
step 4 above with "make -jN" where N is number of CPU cores available.

If you need to see the full text of the commands being executed by "make", add
VERBOSE=1 to the command.  For example, to produce a verbose build, with 12
CPU cores available, step 4 would be:

make -j12 VERBOSE=1

This will result in the tline binary being created as "build-fedora/tline".

5b) RPM builds
==============

Fedora users can use the spec/tline.spec file to generate an RPM as follows:

Note that the "TAG=x.x.x" must be changed to match the version in the
spec file, and that has to match a tag in git.

TAG=1.0.1
git archive --format=tar.gz --prefix=tline-${TAG}/ -o ~/tline-${TAG}.tar.gz tags/${TAG}
rm -fr ~/rpmbuild
mkdir -p ~/rpmbuild/{SPECS,SOURCES}
cp spec/tline.spec ~/rpmbuild/SPECS
mv ~/tline-${TAG}.tar.gz ~/rpmbuild/SOURCES

cd ~/rpmbuild
rpmbuild -ba SPECS/tline.spec

5c) MOCK builds
===============

If you are set up for mock on Fedora, you can use it to do a build, again
adjusting the version string and target Fedora version as necessary.  In
this case, you first generate the source RPM in your local rpmbuild
directory, then pass that to mock.  I like to use two windows for this.

In window 1, in the source directory, do:

TAG=1.0.1
git archive --format=tar.gz --prefix=tline-${TAG}/ -o ~/tline-${TAG}.tar.gz tags/${TAG}
rm -fr ~/rpmbuild
mkdir -p ~/rpmbuild/{SPECS,SOURCES}
cp spec/tline.spec ~/rpmbuild/SPECS
mv ~/tline-${TAG}.tar.gz ~/rpmbuild/SOURCES

In window 2 do:

TAG=1.0.1
cd ~/rpmbuild
rpmbuild -bs SPECS/tline.spec
mock -r fedora-41-x86_64 --rebuild ~/rpmbuild/SRPMS/tline-${TAG}-1.fc41.src.rpm

6) BUILDING FOR UBUNTU
======================

6a) Manual Builds
=================

The following packages are required in order to build and run tline manually
on an Ubuntu system:

apt install build-essential cmake imagemagick librsvg2-bin vim-common \
  libwxbase3.0-dev libwxgtk-webview3.0-gtk3-dev libwxgtk3.0-gtk3-dev \
  gnuplot xterm gsfonts xxd

Newer Ubuntu systems (noble and later) instead use:

apt install build-essential cmake imagemagick librsvg2-bin vim-common \
  libwxgtk-webview3.2-dev libwxgtk3.2-dev gnuplot xterm gsfonts xxd

Once the above requirements are installed, compilation for Ubuntu
can then be done by the following steps:

mkdir build-ubuntu
cd build-ubuntu
cmake ..
make

If you have a multi-core CPU, you can speed up the compilation by replacing
step 4 above with "make -jN" where N is number of CPU cores available.

If you need to see the full text of the commands being executed by "make", add
VERBOSE=1 to the command.  For example, to produce a verbose build, with 12
CPU cores available, step 4 would be:

make -j12 VERBOSE=1

This will result in the tline binary being created as "build-ubuntu/tline".

6b) PDEBUILD builds
===================

If you are set up for pdebuild on Ubuntu (and perhaps on other debian-based
systems), then here are the recommended steps.

First, create the base distributions for whichever variants of Ubuntu you wish
to use, in this case "jammy" and "noble":

sudo pbuilder create --basetgz /var/cache/pbuilder/jammy.tgz \
  --distribution jammy
sudo pbuilder create --basetgz /var/cache/pbuilder/noble.tgz \
  --distribution noble

Then run the builds:

TAG=1.0.1
mkdir ~/build
git archive --format=tar.gz --prefix=tline/ -o ~/build/tline_${TAG}.orig.tar.gz tags/${TAG}

cd ~/build
mkdir jammy noble
tar xvf tline_${TAG}.orig.tar.gz
cd tline
pdebuild --buildresult ~/build/jammy \
  -- --basetgz /var/cache/pbuilder/jammy.tgz
pdebuild --buildresult ~/build/noble \
  -- --basetgz /var/cache/pbuilder/noble.tgz

The results will be in ~/build/jammy and ~/build/noble.

7) BUILDING FOR WINDOWS
=======================

The windows version of TLine is built using the MinGW cross-compilers running
on a Fedora Linux machine.  Also, the NSIS installer is used.  Therefore,
you will want to install mingw64-wxWidgets3.noarch, mingw64-nsis,
mingw64-gcc-c++.x86_64, etc.

Also, Tline for windows uses a number of dlls from various projects.  The dll
files are stored in the windows-installer subdirectory.

Build the Tline.exe file, copy it into the windows-installer directory, and
generate the package:

TAG=1.0.1
mkdir build-windows
cd build-windows
mingw64-cmake -DDEFAULT_PREFIX_PATH=/usr -DTLINE_STRIP=OFF ..
make -j48 && cp tline.exe ../windows-installer
cd ../windows-installer
makensis tline.nsi
mv tline-installer.exe tline-installer-${TAG}.exe
cd -

You will wind up with build-windows/tline-installer-${TAG}.exe, which contains
all the components needed to install and run Tline.

8) Version Changes
==================

If the version number changes, the following files must be updated:

version.h spec/tline.spec INSTALL debian/changelog
