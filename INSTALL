This program uses wxFormBuilder to generate its user interface, so if you want
to make any UI changes, install wxFormBuilder and open tline.fbp.  Typing F8
in wxFormBuilder will regenerate the tlineUI.h and tlineUI.cpp files.

Compilation can be done by typing "make", which will result in the tline
binary being created as "build/tline".  You will need to have a development
version of wxWidgets installed.  On Fedora Linux this is provided by
the wxGTK3-devel package.

There is a simple install target in the makefile that copies tline to ~/bin.
If you want the binary somewhere else, you should either manually copy it
where you like, or you can change the makefile.

tline is reasonably self-contained, but it does use gnuplot for graphing,
so you will need gnuplot installed somewhere accessible by your shell.
